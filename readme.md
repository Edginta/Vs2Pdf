# Viso to PDF

This is a pretty simple tool to automate exporting Visio drawings into a single PDF file.

it uses [Cognidox's OfficeToPDF](https://github.com/cognidox/OfficeToPDF) application to do the actual conversion from Visio to PDf.

It can either export all the Visio files in the list to a pdf of the same name, or merge them into a single file.
